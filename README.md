- Brute force:
    - `./accharvester --brute-login [Username file] [Password file] [Workers]`
    - Password:Username combos will be outputed to the terminal or console.

You can also use the filter \<username\> in your password list like so: \

\<username\>123

It is also advised that you do not use a large password list as that may or may not slow down the program.
